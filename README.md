# Smart EV Navigation
Based on your project structure and the `run.py` code (which initializes and runs a web app via `create_app()`), it appears you're working on a **Python-based web application**, likely using **Flask** or a similar framework.

Here’s a polished `README.md` similar in style to the one in your screenshot:
