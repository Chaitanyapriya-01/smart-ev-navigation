# Smart EV Navigation
Based on your project structure and the `run.py` code (which initializes and runs a web app via `create_app()`), it appears you're working on a **Python-based web application**, likely using **Flask** or a similar framework.

Here’s a polished `README.md` similar in style to the one in your screenshot:

# ⚡ EV Web App

This is a Python-based web application designed to demonstrate a modular, production-ready architecture. It features centralized configuration, clean app initialization, and scalable structure for further development.

---

## 💡 About the Project

This application showcases how to:

* Initialize a modular Python web app using `create_app` pattern.
* Maintain clear project structure with separation of concerns.
* Support easy configuration and debugging setup.
* Provide a ready base for future feature additions like APIs, authentication, dashboards, etc.

Whether you're learning backend development or planning to build a full-featured web service, this project offers a clean and scalable foundation.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Flask** (likely used via `create_app`)
* **Werkzeug / Jinja2** *(depending on templates and routing needs)*
* **HTML/CSS/JS** (for frontend, if included)
* **Gunicorn / WSGI** (for deployment, optionally)
